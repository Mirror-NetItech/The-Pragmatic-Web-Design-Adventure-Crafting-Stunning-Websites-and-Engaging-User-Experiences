           <p class="p">
             Before we dive into the fascinating world of web design, let’s take a moment to lighten the mood. 
             <br>
             You know, they say that web design and web development are like two best friends who always hang out together but sometimes get mistaken for each other.
             <br>
             Kind of like Batman and Robin, or peanut butter and jelly!*
           </p>
           <p class="p">
             <b>Imagine this:</b> web design is that friend who always dresses to impress, making everything look fabulous with colors, fonts, and layouts.  <br>
             Meanwhile, web development is the behind-the-scenes wizard, making sure that everything runs smoothly like the computer nerd who knows how to fix your Wi-Fi when it goes down!
           </p>
           <p class="p">
             <b>But here’s the twist:</b> sometimes they swap outfits! 
             You might hear someone say, “I’m working on my website’s design,” when they’re really writing code, or “I’m developing a new layout,” when they’re just picking the perfect shade of blue.
             It’s like when you call your cat a dog confusing but kind of funny!
           </p>
           <p class="p">
             So today, we’re going to explore why these terms are often used interchangeably and how understanding both can help you create stunning websites that not only look good but work like magic. 
             Ready to unleash your inner web wizard? Let’s get started!

           Web design is the process of creating websites. It encompasses several different aspects, including webpage layout, content production, and graphic design.
         </p>
         <p class="p">
           While the terms web design and web development are often used interchangeably, web design is technically a subset of the broader category of web development.
         </p>
         <h4>So What Exactly Is Web Development?</h4>
         <div class="chat">
<div class="ment other ">
  
	<div class=" bubble" >
	  <b>
	    <p class="p">
	      Web development refers to building, creating, and maintaining websites. It includes aspects such as web design, web publishing, web programming, and database management.
	    </p>
	    <p class="p">
	      While the terms "web developer" and "web designer" are often used synonymously, they do not mean the same thing. Technically, a web designer only designs website interfaces using HTML and CSS. <br>
	      A web developer may be involved in designing a website, but may also write web scripts in languages such as PHP and ASP.
	      <br>
	      Additionally, a web developer may help maintain and update a database used by a dynamic website.
	    </p>
	    <p class="p">
	     Web development includes many types of web content creation.<br>
	     <b class="eg">
	     Some examples include :::</b> hand coding web pages in a text editor, building a website in a program like Dreamweaver, and updating a blog via a blogging website. <br>
	     In recent years, content management systems like WordPress, Drupal, and Joomla have also become popular means of web development. <br> 
	     These tools make it easy for anyone to create and edit their own website using a web-based interface. 
	    </p>
	    <p class="p">
	      While there are several methods of creating websites, there is often a trade-off between simplicity and customization.
	      <br>
	      Therefore, most large businesses do not use content management systems, but instead have a dedicated Web development team that designs and maintains the company's website(s). <br>
	      Small organizations and individuals are more likely to choose a solution like WordPress that provides a basic website template and simplified editing tools. 
	      
	    </p>
	    <p class="p">
	      So in Web Development, developers need expert-level knowledge of a variety of programming languages, including HTML (HyperText Markup Language), CSS, PHP, and JavaScript but also extending to other languages (Ruby, C/C++, Python), frameworks, and libraries <br>
	      While in Web Design, web designers may need knowledge of a programming language or some coding skills, or at least some level of familiarity with widely used languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

<p class="p">
  Alright, so let's get back into our main topic "web design". <br>
  Web design is the process of creating and designing websites that are accessible and visually appealing to users. 
  <br>
  It encompasses a variety of disciplines and skills, including layout design, graphic design, user experience (UX) design, and user interface (UI) design. The goal of web design is to create a website that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also functional and easy to navigate.
  </p>
  <p class="p">
  Websites are created using a markup language called HTML. Web designers build webpages using HTML tags that define the content and metadata of each page.  <br>
  
  The layout and appearance of the elements within a webpage are typically defined using CSS, or cascading style sheets. Therefore, most websites include a combination of HTML and CSS that defines how each page will appear in a browser. <br>
When you visit most websites, you'll notice various icons presented as buttons, such as navigation bar icons and submit buttons. 

Now, since we know that HTML is used for structuring content and CSS is used for styling it, what happens when we click these buttons? Often, something exciting occurs, or we may be redirected from our current page to another page.

The magic behind these interactions is a programming language called JavaScript. 

For example, when you want to sign in to Facebook, you enter your information and click the submit button. What happens next is that JavaScript takes over: it sends your data to a server that stores it and processes it into usable information. 

In summary, JavaScript, in combination with HTML and CSS, enables interactivity in your web browser, making websites dynamic and engaging.
</p>
<p class="p">
  So Html, Css and JavaScript are the main or widely used languages for designing a Website.

        </legend> 
        <p class="p">
      So, in the context of web design, a "website" refers to a collection of web pages that are related to each other and typically hosted on the same domain. <br>
       These pages are designed to be viewed on the internet through a web browser.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          A website serves various purposes, such as providing information, selling products or services, entertaining visitors, or facilitating communication. <br>
          
Web design encompasses the visual aspect, layout, and structure of these websites, as well as the user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) design. <br>
The website can be published on at least one web server and can be identified by a common domain name, <b class="eg">for example :::</b>  mirrornetwork.io, google.com, youtube.com.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          All the websites that are accessible publicly come under the World Wide Web. <br>
          There is a website that is accessed only on a private network.<br>
          Most of the websites are dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, <b class="eg">for example :::</b>, education, news, commerce, entertainment, or Social networking. <br>
          The websites start with a home page, which is followed by some navigation page that is linked by the Hyperlinking between the web pages.
        </p>
        <h4>Let's Look At The Types/Forms Of A Website ::::</h4>
        <p class="p">
          In general we have two types of Websites which are Static and Dynamic websites. <br>
          Let's Take a look at their differences.
        </p>
        <img src="Weboneimg.png" alt="" style="width: 95%; border-radius: 30px; box-shadow: 2px 7px 6px rgba(21, 105, 55, .5)"> <table style="align-content: center; width: 98%; border: 1px;">
          <tr style="background-color: rgba(125, 255, 255, 0.3); font-weight: bolder; text-align: center;">
            <td>Static Website</td>
            <td >Dynamic Website</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>The combination of web pages that are stored on a server in the same format that is sent to a client's web browser is a Static website. <br>
            The static websites are initially coded in the HTML and CSS that are used to control the appearance beyond basic HTML.  <br>
            Using CSS, the images affect the desired appearance and the part of the content. 
            <br>
            It usually displays the same information to all its users. <br>
            <b class="eg">For Example :::</b> a printed paper that will not change. Such as a brochure website.
            </td>
            <td>
              A dynamic website is a collection of webpages that change or customizes itself automatically and frequently. <br>
              The dynamic pages from the will be modified "on the fly" by the computer code. <br>
              There is a wide range of internet software, such as CGI, Java Servlets and Java Server Pages, etc. <br>
              A dynamic site displays the current state of a dialogue between users to provide any information in some way to the user's desired requirement. <br>
              <b class="eg">For Example :::</b> The code running on the webserver might combine with the stored HTML fragments with news stories retrieved from a database when we request a front page of any site.
            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <h4>Categories Of Website ::::</h4>
        
        <ul class="ulstyle">
         <li><b class="phase">Blog Websites ::::</b> Are  types of websites that provides information or in which posts are added regularly in reverse chronological order, latest post or entries on top of the main page, and old ones towards the bottom.
         <p class="p">
           A blog is usually owned by a single person or a small group of people.
           <br>
           The content in a blog is written in an informal or conversational style and can be focused on one subject or a wide range of related subjects.
         </p>
         <p class="p">
           Furthermore, the posts are organized into categories if required, <b class="eg">e.g</b>, posts that provide similar information can be kept in a separate category. <br>
           The content of a blog is generally referred to as a blog post, and it generally appears as posts on a streaming page.

        </legend> 
        <p class="p">
          In the context of web design, HTTP refers to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, which is the underlying protocol used for communication between web browsers and web servers.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          When designing a website, understanding HTTP is important because it dictates how information is requested and delivered over the internet.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
         Web designers need to consider various aspects of HTTP to ensure that their websites are optimized for performance, security, and usability. 
        </p>
        <h4>Some key considerations related to HTTP in web design include ::::</h4>
              <div class="chat">
<div class="ment other ">
  
	<div class=" bubble" > 	 
	<ul class="ulstyle">
	  <li>
	    <b style="color: black">Request methods ::::</b> HTTP provides different request methods, such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
Web designers need to choose the appropriate method based on the purpose of the request. <br>
<b class="eg">For Example</b> GET is commonly used to retrieve data, while POST is used for submitting data to a server. 
	  </li>
	  <li><b style="color: black">URL Structure ::::</b> The URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is an essential element of HTTP requests. <br>
Web designers should create well-structured URLs that are easy to understand and navigate. <br>
This includes using descriptive keywords, organizing content into logical directories, and avoiding excessive parameters.</li>
<li><b style="color: black">Status codes ::::</b> HTTP responses include status codes that indicate the outcome of a request.
Web designers should be familiar with common status codes, such is the following <br>
<b style=" color: green; font-size: bolder;"> Examples include</b>
				             </li>
		<table border="2" style="background: linen; border-radius: 20px; color: black">
			 <tr>
				<th>Codes</th>
				 <th>Meaning</th>
				 </tr>
				 <tr>
				 <td><h3>200</h3></td>
				 <td>successful request <b style="color: brown">(</b>the webpage exists <b style="color: brown">)</b></td>
				 </tr>
				 <tr>
				 <td><h3>301</h3></td>
				 <td>moved permanently <b style="color: brown">(</b>often forwarded to a new URL <b style="color: brown">)</b></td>
				 </tr>
				 <tr>
				<td><h3>401</h3></td>
				<td>unauthorized request <b style="color: brown">(</b>authorization required <b style="color: brown">)</b></td>
				 </tr>
				 <tr>
				 <td><h3>403</h3></td>
				<td>forbidden <b style="color: brown">(</b>access is not allowed to the page or directory <b style="color: brown">)</b></td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
				<td><h3>500</h3></td>
				<td>internal server error <b style="color: brown">(</b>often caused by an incorrect server configuration<b style="color: brown">)</b></td>
				 </tr>
				</table> <br>
				to handle errors and provide appropriate feedback to users.
</li>
<li>
  <b style="color: black">Caching ::::</b> HTTP supports caching mechanisms that allow browsers to store and reuse previously retrieved resources.
  <br>
Web designers can leverage caching to improve website performance by specifying cache-control headers and utilizing techniques like browser caching and CDN (Content Delivery Network) caching.
</li>
<li><b style="color: black">Security ::::</b> HTTP alone does not provide strong security measures, as data is transmitted in plain text.
<br>
To enhance security, web designers should consider implementing HTTPS (HTTP Secure) using SSL/TLS certificates.
This ensures that data is encrypted during transmission, protecting it from unauthorized access.

</li>
<li><b style="color: black">Performance optimization ::::</b> Web designers should optimize HTTP requests and responses to minimize load times and improve website performance.
<br>
This can involve techniques such as reducing file sizes, compressing resources, combining multiple requests into one, and leveraging browser caching.
</li>
	</ul>

	</div>
</div>
	<p class="p">
	  HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that each request-response cycle is independent and does not retain any information about previous requests. <br>
However, mechanisms like cookies and sessions are used to maintain state and enable more complex interactions between clients and servers.
	</p>
	<p class="p">
	  Over the years, several versions of HTTP have been developed, with HTTP/1.1 being the most widely used version currently. <br>
The latest version, HTTP/2, introduced several performance improvements to enhance web browsing speed and efficiency.
	</p>
	<p class="p">
	  Overall, HTTP is crucial for the functioning of the web, enabling the retrieval and display of web pages and facilitating communication between clients and servers.
	  <br>
By understanding and implementing best practices related to HTTP, web designers can create websites that are efficient, secure, and user-friendly.

        </legend>
        <p class="p">
          A web server is a computer program or software that serves as the foundation for hosting and delivering websites and web applications over the internet.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          It runs Web server software, such as Apache or Microsoft IIS, which provides access to hosted webpages over the Internet. <br>
Most Web servers are connected to the Internet via a high-speed connection, offering OC-3 or faster data transmission rates. <br>
A fast Internet connection allows Web servers to support multiple connections at one time without slowing down. <br>
Any computer can be used as a Web server, as long as it is connected to the Internet and has the appropriate software installed.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
         However, most Web servers are 1U rack-mounted systems, meaning they are flat, trimmed down computers that can be mounted on a server rack. <br>
Most Web hosting companies have several server racks, which each contain multiple servers. 
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          This is the most space-efficient way to host a large number of websites from a single location. <br>
Web servers typically host multiple websites. Some only host a few, while others may host several hundred.
Web servers that host websites for multiple users are called "shared hosts." <br>
This is the most common type of hosting solution and is used for personal sites, small business sites, and websites run by small organizations.
        </p>
        <p class="p">
          Web servers that only host websites for a single person or company are called "dedicated hosts." These types of servers are appropriate for high-traffic websites and sites that require custom server modifications. <br>
          
Dedicated hosts are also more reliable than shared hosts, since there are fewer sites that can cause bottlenecks or other issues with the server.

        </legend> 
        <p class="p">
          In the context of web design, URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. 
It is the address used to locate a specific resource on the internet, such as a web page, image, or document.

<div class="ment other ">
  	<div class=" bubble" >
	  <ul class="ulstyle">
     <li><b style="color: black">Protocol ::::</b> This indicates the communication protocol used to access the resource. <br> 
     The most common protocol is HTTP ( Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for regular web pages, and HTTPS (HTTP Secure) for secure connections.</li> 
     <li><b style="color: black">Domain Name ::::</b> 
     This identifies the specific website or server where the resource is hosted. <br>
It typically includes the second-level domain (SLD) and the top-level domain (TLD), such as example.com.
     </li>
     <li>
       <b style="color: black">Path ::::</b> This specifies the specific location or directory on the server where the resource is located. <br>
It may include multiple directories separated by slashes (/) and can also include a file name and extension.
     </li>
     <li><b style="color: black">Query Parameters ::::</b> These are optional parameters that can be appended to the URL to provide additional information to the server or web application. <br>
They are typically separated from the rest of the URL by a question mark (?) and can include key-value pairs.</li>
    </ul>
	</div>
	</div>
</div>
      <b class="eg">Let's Check Out An Example :::</b>
      <p class="p">
        In the URL <b style="color: deeppink">"https://example.com/blog/post?id=123"</b> 
        <br>
          <b style="color: deeppink">"https://"</b> is the protocol, <br>
          <b style="color: deeppink">" example.com"</b> is the domain name, <br>
          <b style="color: deeppink">" /blog/post "</b> is the path, and <br>
          <b style="color: deeppink">"?id=123"</b> is the query parameter. 
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        URLs are important in web design as they serve as the unique address for each page or resource on a website. <br>
Web designers often ensure that URLs are user-friendly, descriptive, and optimized for search engines to improve usability and SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
